title: Collection of remarkable tweets
description: For the past month I've published several articles on <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> containing some of my favorite tweets I've collected (liked) so far. I think you would like them too!

I tend to use Twitter likes to bookmark interesting content, just not for everything I consider likable. From time-to-time, I also go through the list and un-like what I don't find interesting anymore. This approach keeps my list of liked tweets short, consisting only from the content I'd enjoy in the future.

That's what happened with tweets I found as wise as funny - in the end, I got dozens of them. So why not to share? The series includes 4 posts, issued every Friday in the past month.

**1 post equals 10 tweets**. Here they are:

- [part #1](https://dev.to/rmnvsl/why-so-serious-1-276j)
- [part #2](https://dev.to/rmnvsl/why-so-serious-collection-of-remarkable-tweets-2-10hj)
- [part #3](https://dev.to/rmnvsl/why-so-serious-collection-of-remarkable-tweets-3-mgo)
- [part #4](https://dev.to/rmnvsl/why-so-serious-collection-of-remarkable-tweets-4-28g0)

Pause for a while, go through them and a have a good time!
