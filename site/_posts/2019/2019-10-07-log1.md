description: "<a href=\"https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/\">Learning in public</a> has gained pretty big popularity across my twitter circles. Surely, the concept isn't new, but now it has a name. As being a curious person myself, I've started collecting my findings from dealing with day-to-day tasks a while ago. Now it's time to publish the coherent form of the notes in the first post of the learning log series and so become the part of the wave."

- I was experimenting with CSS pseudo elements and generated content to find out if it is possible to use it as a base for other selectors - it isn't. [Live example](https://t.co/FriKFVU3MP?amp=1).
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sadly, you can&#39;t use generated content as a base of your selector in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/css?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#css</a><br><br>See <a href="https://t.co/FriKFVU3MP">https://t.co/FriKFVU3MP</a> <a href="https://t.co/5mQPGY5nsw">pic.twitter.com/5mQPGY5nsw</a></p>&mdash; Roman Vesel√Ω (@rmnvsl) <a href="https://twitter.com/rmnvsl/status/1122487791152242688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2019</a></blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
- `window` resize event behaves a bit unexpected, well, just at a first glance. It is fired almost whenever you scroll a page in the mobile browser. My investigation revealed it's the correct behavior. It's common for mobile browsers to show/hide omnibar or other toolbars while scrolling up & down which _does_ change the size of the visible area - thus [firing the event _is_ expected](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/url-bar-resizing?authuser=0).
- Staying in sync with the project's dependencies versions across different workstations and servers can be sometimes problematic. [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci) can help with many issues. It stands for a clean install and is available since [version 5.7.0](<https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.7.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.7.0)>). It installs dependencies only from your `package-lock.json` file (it also removes `node_modules` directory). It should be used in the CI environment, project setup, etc. I've started using it in all my projects ever since.
- Icon fonts have still their place even in today's world of wide SVG support. With [fontello.com](http://fontello.com/) is possible to easily create one font with characters from different sets. And that's very handy!
- Don't know why, but I have been neglecting CSS [`background-position`'s offsets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#Values) for a very long time. Probably I forgot it exists! I'm pleased I've discovered it just recently. Now I'm again able to position background images relative to the edges of their elements.

See you next time.
