              description: "I like to take notes and keep a daily journal so I have tried many apps for that purpose, but none of them fulfilled my expectations. Since I use Google Calendar quite a lot and in many different aspects of my life, I decided to keep notes inside, in the descriptions of the events. This browser extension makes it easier to read them. Give it a try."

            - name: Statie  Site
              title: Documentation site for Statie, simple PHP static site generator
              description: "In late 2017 I found an Adam Wathan's article on <a href=\"https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/\">CSS utility classes</a>. I had only heard about tachyons until that time and didn't like the concept very much. But I dived in and changed my mind. I wanted to use his Tailwind CSS framework, but I was not working on anything suitable for it to try. Shortly I came with an idea for a new site for Statie, simple PHP static site generator, which I had been already using for my own site. It lacked its home, so I acquainted with the new CSS methodology while making one for it!"
