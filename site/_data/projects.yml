                title: "Browser extension that shows events' descriptions in Google Calendar."
                description: "I like to take notes and keep a daily journal so I have tried many apps for that purpose, but none of them fulfilled my expectations. Since I use Google Calendar quite a lot and in many different aspects of my life, I decided to keep notes inside, in the descriptions of the events. This browser extension makes it easier to read them. Give it a try."
