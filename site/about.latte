<p>My first websites were transmitted awkwardly on floppy disks. <a href="http://joecartoon.com/">Flash</a> and <a href="http://ps2.praystation.com/pound/v3/">ActionScript</a> proved me that web may be really fun. I have been devoted to the frontend development for many years and currently use tools like <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, <a href="https://nette.org/">Nette</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> to solve things. I'm also experienced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP">ABAP</a> development in <a href="http://go.sap.com/">SAP</a> systems.</p>

<p>I love science fiction, either as a film or a book. My body is tormented during run or in a gym regularly. Walks in the nature, more-day hiking as well as camping are something I cannot live without. I like to learn new things to become better than yesterday and often deal with the smallest details to make something great. I come from Kosice, Slovakia.</p>

<p>From time-to-time I express my thoughts in non-technical way and <a href="https://dennikn.sk/autor/iafke/">write in my native language</a>.</p>
