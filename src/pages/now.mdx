My attention has been focused on moving to my new apartment for the past year. Finally, the reconstruction, delayed many times due to the pandemic, is finished and I can now slowly start to focus on the things I have been postponing because of it-mostly my physical training, ... and my writing. I'd like to blog a bit about my experience of working on a new design system. Not having written anything for more than a year makes coming back to a typewriter harder than I'd expect.

Besides the design system implementation, I am immersed in the micro-frontends and discovering the right approach for a wide range of applications inside our company. It'll be very interesting once we start the migration under one "frontend roof".

I am happy that [Krystal](https://crazko.github.io/krystal/), a plugin for [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), has gained so much popularity. It is my first project that received so much (positive!) feedback. There have even been contributors posting their pull requests with new feature suggestions and bug fixes. It's very encouraging. I hope I will find more time to work on this plugin, even though I think its potential is almost fulfilled.
