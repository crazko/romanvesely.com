Some months have passed since I joined [ZOOM](https://www.zoomint.com/) and started working on a [workforce management](https://www.eleveo.com/) SaaS application. I take care of the frontend part of the application, but the whole architecture is really interesting. The app is served from the cloud as well as is available on-premise. This is probably the first time I contribute to the company's product meant to be consumed by clients directly. I appreciate this change.

In my spare time, I have been able to finally release [Kalendario](https://kalendario.org/), an extension for web browsers. And, just recently, a [custom React hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dencrypt-effect) that generates crypting text effect. I made it because of [one of my projects](https://vojdivon.sk/), but I'm really surprised people started to use it as well despite I've done no public promotion.

I wanted to play with generative art, but I haven't found any time for that since the last summer. And as I just got inspired by the list of [Brutalist Websites](https://brutalistwebsites.com/), my thoughts are playing with an idea of transforming my web into something more, let's say, experimental.
