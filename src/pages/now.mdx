I'm about to change a job, soon joining company [ZOOM](https://www.zoomint.com/), specialized on the software for contact centers.

After months I've finally found some time to work on my first and only browser extension [calex](https://github.com/crazko/calex). It was developed for a currently deprecated version of Google Calendar and stopped working since the change of the design. I hope I will release a new version soon, completely refactored. I learned a ton while working on it!

After the successful release, I want to start tinkering with generative art, possibly with AI incorporated.
