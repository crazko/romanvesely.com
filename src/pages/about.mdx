I created my first website in the age of floppy disks. [Flash](http://joecartoon.com/) and [ActionScript](http://ps2.praystation.com/pound/v3/) proved me that web may be really fun. I have been devoted to the frontend development for many years and currently being working mainly with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I also use tools like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Nette](https://nette.org/) orÂ [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) to solve things on the backend side. Furthermore, I'm experienced in [ABAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP) development in [SAP](http://go.sap.com/) systems.

My interest is in the open source, static sites, continuous integration, security and decentralized applications.

I love science fiction, either as a film or a book. My body is tormented during run or in a gym regularly. Walks in the nature, more-day hiking as well as camping are something I cannot live without. I like to learn new things and often deal with the smallest details to make something great. I come from the beautiful city of Kosice, Slovakia.

From time-to-time I express my thoughts in non-technical way and [write in my native language](https://dennikn.sk/autor/iafke/).
