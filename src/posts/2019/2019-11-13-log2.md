- Level up your git terminal skills. `git add -N` adds a new file to the history without its content. Then it is easy to see the whole file with `git diff` and add only some portions of it with `git add -p`. Kudos to https://dev.to/oscherler/comment/cjb8
- The security of the system must be preserved even when its architecture and functionality is publicly known, as far as the keys stay secure. [Kerckhoffs principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle) about cryptosystems.
- One more tip on security - keep opened tabs safe and use `rel="noopener"` attribute. Asking why? Find [the answer](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/). There's also a nice [eslint rule for JSX](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md).
- npm comes with some very handy scripts by default, which one of them is `npm version`. It is used to bump your package version (in package and shrinkwrap files). In a git repository, it also creates a commit and adds a tag in [semver](https://semver.org/) notation. This step might not be desirable when you use a different type of versioning, so it can be skipped by running it with `--no-git-tag-version`.
- Bad Frost is a father of [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) concept, which is now 6 years old. In [his article](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/extending-atomic-design/) he writes about the inception of the idea and how have the design systems changed throughout the years. If you work with CSS you may like the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology which clicks with this concept very well.
- Did you know the difference between `border-bottom`'s values `0`, `none` and `hidden`? Neither did I! See [examples and explanations](https://codepen.io/denilsonsa/pen/LkdHh?editors=110).

See you next time.
