- This article is part of my **Learning in public** series - it's a quest to be as open as possible. But there's also kind of a counterpart to such spreading movement, that has probably always been a part of the World Wide Web - dark web. Beware, not [The Dark Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web), but **[The Real Dark Web](https://www.sonniesedge.net/posts/real-dark-web/)** - rarely acknowledged majority of web developers.
- I have recently revealed my [first browser extension](/journaling), which enhances Google Calendar. To work it needs to fetch calendar data from Google API. There is a neverending (okay, several steps...) approval process one has to undergo to get API access. To make the extension work also under Firefox I had to specifically [request support to whitelist `allizom.com`](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/firefox-webextension-and-oauth-browser-identity-getredirecturl-with-google-resolved/42362) as a verified domain. It just cannot be simpler, everything for the user's security...
- Is your project compiled from TypeScript? Are you too strict? If so, you may like [`--strict` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/v2/en/tsconfig#strict). It's a shorthand for enabling all (currently 7) strict type-checking options. You can always turn off individual options if needed.
- Some time ago I was struggling with TypeScript **generic types** and decided to reach for [help from smarter guys on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50371994/typescript-type-guarding-of-argument-based-on-the-previous-one). I received an answer, thanks! The solution is based on very specific **conditional type** which I was not familiar with back then,... and I'm probably still not. But, there is a one truly [helpful talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1rn-d_P_Rc) by [Gregor Woiwode](https://twitter.com/gregonnet) describing the matter of this TypeScript magic. I really recommend you to watch if you want to understand it better.
- How to make your application faster? Firstly, you may want to know how does it behave under a slow connection. To get an idea of what is it like, developers at Facebook have **2G Tuesday**s - simulating slow connection for the whole one day. This is how the performance should be tested! From the talk [New adventures in front-end](https://slideslive.com/38919333) by [Vitaly Friedman](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/vitaly-friedman/).
- How to make your application more accessible? What about to include [No mouse day](https://www.npmjs.com/package/no-mouse-days) into your development process?

That's enough for now, see you next time!
