[Learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) has gained pretty big popularity across my twitter circles. Surely, the concept isn't new, but now it has a name. As being a curious person myself, I've started collecting my findings from dealing with day-to-day tasks a while ago. Now it's time to publish the coherent form of the notes in the first post of the learning log series and so become the part of the wave.

<Log id="0001" />
<Log id="0002" />
<Log id="0003" />
<Log id="0004" />
<Log id="0005" />

See you next time.
