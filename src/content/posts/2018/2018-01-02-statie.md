Documentation site for Statie, simple PHP static site generator.

In late 2017 I found an Adam Wathan's article on [CSS utility classes](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/). I had only heard about tachyons until that time and didn't like the concept very much. But I dived in and changed my mind. I wanted to use his Tailwind CSS framework, but I was not working on anything suitable for it to try. Shortly I came with an idea for a new site for Statie, simple PHP static site generator, which I had been already using for my own site. It lacked its home, so I acquainted with the new CSS methodology while making one for it!
