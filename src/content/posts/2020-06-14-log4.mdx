More JavaScript and TypeScript stuff, tips for GitHub and offline world.

Sidenote: now, you can find the content of all my [Learning Log](/log) together in one place. It should be easier for me to add new pieces more frequently. I can also [transclude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion) the content of any individual log anywhere where a React component can be used thanks to the new [`<Log />` component](https://github.com/crazko/romanvesely.com/blob/master/src/components/Log.jsx). RSS ~~may come later~~ is [also available](/log.xml).

## JS/TS related:

<Log id="0020" />
<Log id="0019" />
<Log id="0022" />
<Log id="0023" />

## GitHub Tip

<Log id="0021" />

## Offline Behaviour

<Log id="0018" />

That's enough for now, see you next time!
