It's possible to limit the number of lines in a block element with [`-webkit-line-clamp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-line-clamp) CSS property.
Although, it must be accompained with some additional properties to work:

```css
p {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

[Browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_-webkit-line-clamp) is sufficient.
In the future, it might be replaced with `line-clamp` property.
