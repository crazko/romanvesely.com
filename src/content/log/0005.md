Don't know why, but I have been neglecting CSS [`background-position`'s offsets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#Values) for a very long time. Probably I forgot it exists! I'm pleased I've discovered it just recently. Now I'm again able to position background images relative to the edges of their elements.
