When working with `password` inputs, it's possible to add a bit more information on [how the `autocomplete` should work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password#Allowing_autocomplete). It can be set `on` and `off`, but the real power comes with options `current-password` and `new-password`. The former allows the browser to enter the known password - suitable for the login form. The later allows the browser to suggest (create) a new password - suitable for sign up or "forgotten password" forms.
