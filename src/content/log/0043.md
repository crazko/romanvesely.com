There are situations where [forced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors) [colors](https://polypane.app/blog/forced-colors-explained-a-practical-guide/) should be disabled even when the rest of the page stays in high contrast mode.
Example is a color selector in an eshop page.
Reduced color palette would deteriorate user experience.

You can turn off forced colors with [`forced-color-adjust: none`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/forced-color-adjust).
