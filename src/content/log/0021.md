In GitHub, you can highlight not only the code syntax but also a differences, just like with `git diff` command. It may be very helpful while providing some step by step guides in READMEs or issues.

Here's the syntax:

````
```diff
+foo
-bar
baz
```
````

that results in:

```diff
+foo
-bar
baz
```

Unfortunately, it's not possible to use both language syntax and diff highlighting together.
