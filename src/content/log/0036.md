Wouldn't it be helpful to see type hints in JavaScript configuration files? Let's say, for [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) configuration, so you have at least a glance of [all the possibilities](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#big-list-of-options)?

Thankfully it can be done with [JSDoc `@type` tag](https://jsdoc.app/tags-type.html)! Example:

```js
// rollup.config.js

/** @type {import('rollup/dist/rollup').RollupOptions[]} */
export default [
  {
    input: "./index.js",
    // ...
  },
];
```

I think that's really neat!
