npm comes with some very handy scripts by default, which one of them is `npm version`. It is used to bump your package version (in package and shrinkwrap files). In a git repository, it also creates a commit and adds a tag in [semver](https://semver.org/) notation. This step might not be desirable when you use a different type of versioning, so it can be skipped by running it with `--no-git-tag-version`.
