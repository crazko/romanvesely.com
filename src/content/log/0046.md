[Capability URLs](https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/) are unique, hard-to-guess links that grant access to specific resources without requiring traditional authentication.
Possession of the URL itself serves as permission to access the information.

Once a user has accessed a page through such an URL, they are able to do all they need to do within that page.

Some of the examples are: Google Calendar share links or password reset links.
