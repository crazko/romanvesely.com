[Lazy consensus](https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/mediums/lazy_consensus/) is a decision-making process where silence means approval.
It encourages participants to take initiative and lowers the cost of governance.
It is used within various open-source projects teams and organizations, such as [Apache Software Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html) or [Adobe Spectum team](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-to-committer).
