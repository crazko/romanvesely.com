Bad Frost is a father of [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) concept, which is now 6 years old. In [his article](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/extending-atomic-design/) he writes about the inception of the idea and how have the design systems changed throughout the years. If you work with CSS you may like the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology which clicks with this concept very well.
