One more tip on security - keep opened tabs safe and use `rel="noopener"` attribute. Asking why? Find [the answer](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/). There's also a nice [eslint rule for JSX](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md).
