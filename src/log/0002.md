`window` resize event behaves a bit unexpected, well, just at a first glance. It is fired almost whenever you scroll a page in the mobile browser. My investigation revealed it's the correct behavior. It's common for mobile browsers to show/hide omnibar or other toolbars while scrolling up & down which _does_ change the size of the visible area - thus [firing the event _is_ expected](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/url-bar-resizing?authuser=0).
