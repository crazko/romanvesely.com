While watching a [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiCRutGzGBw) I spotted some CSS properties I've never seen before. The presenter used `block-size`, `inline-size` or `padding-inline`, and some others as well. I immediately thought those must be ones I neglect due to their lack of support in browsers. [I was correct](https://caniuse.com/?search=logical%20properties) but also learned that they are part of the CSS module [Logical Properties and Values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties), which properties depend on [writing mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode). Great for multilingual sites.
