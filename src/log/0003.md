Staying in sync with the project's dependencies versions across different workstations and servers can be sometimes problematic. [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci) can help with many issues. It stands for a clean install and is available since [version 5.7.0](<https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.7.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.7.0)>). It installs dependencies only from your `package-lock.json` file (it also removes `node_modules` directory). It should be used in the CI environment, project setup, etc. I've started using it in all my projects ever since.
