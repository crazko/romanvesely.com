I have recently revealed my [first browser extension](/journaling), which enhances Google Calendar. To work it needs to fetch calendar data from Google API. There is a neverending (okay, several steps...) approval process one has to undergo to get API access. To make the extension work also under Firefox I had to specifically [request support to whitelist `allizom.com`](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/firefox-webextension-and-oauth-browser-identity-getredirecturl-with-google-resolved/42362) as a verified domain. It just cannot be simpler, everything for the user's security...
