Some time ago I was struggling with TypeScript **generic types** and decided to reach for [help from smarter guys on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50371994/typescript-type-guarding-of-argument-based-on-the-previous-one). I received an answer, thanks! The solution is based on very specific **conditional type** which I was not familiar with back then,... and I'm probably still not. But, there is a one truly [helpful talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1rn-d_P_Rc) by [Gregor Woiwode](https://twitter.com/gregonnet) describing the matter of this TypeScript magic. I really recommend you to watch if you want to understand it better.
