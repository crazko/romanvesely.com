In `git`, a commit is referenced via its hash value - 40 digit string. Usually, only the first 8 digits are used, as that's enough to be able to (visually) differentiate one commit with others. Alas, it may lead to a security hole if such a way is used in, let's say, a build script - because of **Commit Hash Collisions**. Thanks to that, one might also [take down Github Actions](https://blog.teddykatz.com/2019/11/12/github-actions-dos.html).
